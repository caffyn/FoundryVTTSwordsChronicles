Whenever you sleep, roll 1d6. On a 6, you experience an oracular dream. Premonitions are simple dreams, more emotion and feeling than concrete images. They are warnings of trouble in your personal life, and provide inspiration and strength to make it through those events. In game terms, you may choose any single test the following day to gain a +1D on, reflecting a sudden insight into the difficulty and how to navigate it best. Another way that premonitions might be employed is when spending or burning a Destiny Point to edit a scene, allowing you to have retroactively dreamt of this situation (although such dreams aren&rsquo;t always believed or remembered when they happen). In such a situation, the scene editing results from the character gaining insight from the dream. Portents are prophetic dreams, powerful visions of what is to come&mdash; or of what is happening now. The dreams are filled with various metaphors and symbolic images. The meaning behind the dreams is not always obvious, but once you have experienced one, you will see the fulfillment of your visions in the unfolding of the events around you. You may also choose the nature of a portent. By spending a Destiny Point, you may choose the symbolism and meaning of a portent, granting you a +1D that may be used toward making that dream come true. Unlike premonitions, this bonus remains for longer than a single day, waiting until it is used. (It is notable that it is not the character, but the player, who chooses the content and goals of this dream; it is just another dream filled with strange symbols to the character.) If your Narrator has a portent ready, when you experience a prophetic dream, you receive that portent.
